A minimalistic vite-starter-template with customized bootstrap imports.

## Getting started
Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
Run `npm run dev` to run dev server.
Start coding.

## Useful information
* Currently, we are using sass v1.32 for not being annoyed by the deprecation warnings regarding the division handling by Bootstrap
* Keep in mind that the order of the required bootstrap files (*_bootstrap_required.scss*) must be changed depending on the contents of your *_overrides.scss*-file
* The *ui.js* is only a small example file to show how imports work. You can use as many files and components as you want.
